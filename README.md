# Why did i make this?
soo i was using my amazon fire tablet and i noticed NONE of the custom launcher mods worked on my fire tablet, so of course i just HAD to make something to help you guys and umm its made in automate so um i had to make my own automate app (it was easy) but i wanted to automate it a little more so i made a custom adb script that is automated
